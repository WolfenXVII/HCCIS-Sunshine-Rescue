                cuddles and kisses, however he is not ready for a home yet as he is still quite timid. Bowser was found
                abandoned in a box on the side of the road, but is lucky enough to have a second chance at a loving
                family.</p>

                nervous around people, but we are giving him lots of love, so he can be adopted into a loving home. Jack
